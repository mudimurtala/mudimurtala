The **Personal Expense Tracker** is designed as a short project to practice and understand the use of HTML tables. It displays data in a tabular format, organizing expenses by date, description, category, and amount, with a calculated total.

## Features

- **Date**: Displays the date of the expense.
- **Expense Description**: A short description of the expense.
- **Category**: Categorizes the expense (e.g., Food, Transport).
- **Amount**: Displays the amount spent in Nigerian Naira (₦).
- **Total Calculation**: Sums up the total amount spent.

Example code snippet for adding a new expense:

```html
<tr>
    <td>2024-08-20</td>
    <td>Groceries</td>
    <td>Food</td>
    <td>₦1500.00</td>
