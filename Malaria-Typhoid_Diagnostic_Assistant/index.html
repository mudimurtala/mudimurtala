        <h2>Malaria in Nigeria</h2>

        <p>
            Malaria is one of the most common diseases in Nigeria, 
            primarily caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted
            through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. With a 
            tropical climate conducive to mosquito breeding, Nigeria experiences
            high rates of malaria infections year-round.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Symptoms of Malaria</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Common Symptoms:</li>
            <p>
                Early symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, and sweating.
                Other initial signs may be headaches, muscle pain, nausea, 
                and vomiting.
            </p>
            <li>Severe Symptoms:</li>
            <p>
                In cases where malaria goes untreated or becomes severe,
                symptoms may progress to include anemia, respiratory distress,
                and in extreme cases, cerebral malaria (affecting the brain).
                Severe malaria can be life-threatening without immediate treatment.
            </p>
          </ul>

          <h3>Prevention of Malaria</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs):</li>
            <p>
                Sleeping under treated mosquito nets reduces the chance of mosquito bites,
                especially in malaria-prone areas.
            </p>
            <li>Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS)</li>
            <p>
                Spraying insecticides indoors is an effective
                measure to reduce malaria-carrying mosquitoes.
            </p>
            <li>Preventive Medication:</li>
            <p>
                Preventive medications can be taken in high-risk areas.
                They’re especially recommended for pregnant women and children,
                who are more vulnerable to severe malaria complications.

        <h2>Typhoid Fever in Nigeria</h2>

        <p>
            Typhoid fever, caused by the Salmonella typhi bacteria,
            is commonly spread through contaminated food and water.
            In Nigeria, factors such as inadequate sanitation and limited
            access to clean drinking water contribute to high rates of typhoid infections.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Symptoms of Typhoid Fever</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Early Symptoms:</li>
            <p>
                The onset of typhoid usually includes symptoms like high fever,
                fatigue, abdominal pain, headache, and sometimes a rash.
                Symptoms often resemble malaria, making it challenging
                to differentiate without proper testing.
            </p>
            <li>Advanced Symptoms:</li>
            <p>
                If untreated, typhoid can lead to severe issues like intestinal
                perforation, confusion, and even life-threatening complications.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Prevention of Typhoid Fever</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Safe Drinking Water: </li>
            <p>
                Use boiled or bottled water for drinking,
                and avoid ice made from untreated water in high-risk areas.
            </p>
            <li>Vaccination:</li>
            <p>
                Vaccines can provide some protection, especially for people traveling
                to or living in high-risk areas. However, vaccination is not a replacement
                for practicing safe food and water habits.
            </p>
            <li>Food Safety:</li>
            <p>
                Wash and cook foods thoroughly. Avoid raw or undercooked meats,
                unwashed vegetables, and street food in areas with poor sanitation.
