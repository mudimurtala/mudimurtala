# JSON Practice App

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates how to work with JSON files in JavaScript. It reads configuration settings from a `config.json` file, displays them on a webpage, and allows for basic interactions with the data.

## Features

- **Read JSON**: The app reads and displays data from a JSON configuration file.
- **Dynamic Display**: Configuration settings like app name, theme colors, and user preferences are displayed dynamically on the page.
- **Update Config (In Progress)**: There's a button to simulate updating the configuration, and the goal is to implement real-time changes to the displayed data.
- **Styling**: The app includes basic CSS for layout and formatting.
