# SVG Loader

## Description

This project features a simple SVG-based loading animation created using HTML and CSS. The loader consists of a rotating circle with animated strokes to create a visually appealing loading effect.

## Features

- **Rotating Loader**: The SVG circle rotates continuously to indicate loading.
- **Animated Stroke**: The stroke of the circle animates with a dash effect, giving the appearance of progress.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the SVG loader.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styling and animations for the SVG loader.

## How It Works

### HTML

The SVG element is used to create a circle that acts as the loader. The `circle` element has attributes for its center position, radius, stroke, and fill.

### CSS

- **Keyframes**:
  - `rotate`: Defines the rotation animation of the circle.
  - `dash`: Defines the stroke dash animation.

- **Animations**:
  - The `circle` element is animated to rotate and have a dashed stroke effect using CSS animations.
